## About Me

I‚Äôm **Matin Moqadas**, a Master‚Äôs student in **Artificial Intelligence** at the University of Isfahan, currently based in **Tehran, Iran**. My research focuses on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, especially **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with privacy-preserving techniques.

As a **Patent Analyst & Junior AI Engineer** at Entekhab Group, I handle AI-driven analysis for patent applications and develop **NLP & RAG-based systems** using frameworks like **Hugging Face Transformers** and **LangChain**. I‚Äôm fluent in Python, PyTorch, and LaTeX, and actively seeking collaborative research or R.A. roles that bridge academia with impactful industry projects.
